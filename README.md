### Attach the components to motherboard
The motherboard has to be prepared before its installation. To prepare the motherboard, you first need to install the CPU, then the heat sink on the CPU and CPU fan.
### CPU :
The CPU and motherboard are sensitive to electrostatic discharge. So place them on a grounded anti‑static mat and wear an anti‑static wrist strap while handling the CPU. When handling a CPU, do not touch the CPU contacts at any point. The CPU is secured to the socket on the motherboard with a locking assembly. 
Thermal compound which is used to conduct heat away from the CPU is applied on the top of CPU. In case of an old CPU, first clean the top of the CPU, and then apply the thermal compound. Clean the top of the CPU and the base of the heat sink with isopropyl alcohol and a lint‑free cloth. This removes the old thermal compound. Then apply a new layer of thermal compound.

### Heat sink and fan assembly
Heat sink and fan assembly is a two‑part cooling device. The heat sink draws heat away from the CPU. The fan moves the heat away from the heat sink. The assembly has a 3‑pin power connector.
To install a CPU and heat sink and fan assembly, follow these steps:
o	First, open the CPU load plate. Align the CPU orientation so that the notches on the CPU are aligned with the orientation keys on CPU socket.
o	Place the CPU gently into the socket.
o	Close the CPU load plate and the load lever.
o	Apply a small amount of thermal compound to top of the CPU
o	Screw the CPU fan on the heat sink.
o	Align the heat sink and fan assembly with the holes on the motherboard.
o	Place the assembly onto the CPU socket carefully.
o	Screw the assembly on the motherboard.      
o	Connect the assembly power cable to the CPU fan connector on the motherboard
